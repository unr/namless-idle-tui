# Emotion Merchant (Name TBD)

A terminal-based idle game where you trade in the economy of feelings. Extract emotions from experiences, refine them into pure essence, and serve customers seeking specific emotional states.

## A notice about vibe coding

This is mostly a vibe coded experimental project in my spare time, investigating how to solve ideas for side projects in new technology. The primary focus here is to mess around with python, the terminal, and game design in general. A _vast_ majority of the code written at this time is not written by me.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - a fast Python package manager:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Terminal Version

```bash
# Clone and setup (installs all dependencies automatically)
git clone <repository>
cd idle-tui
uv sync --all-extras

# Run in terminal
uv run python -m src.idle_game.app
```

### Web Version

The app can also run in your browser using Textual's web server:

```bash
# Same setup as above
uv sync --all-extras

# Run web server
uv run textual serve --port 8080 src.idle_game.app:IdleGame

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

**Why uv?** 10-100x faster than pip, automatic virtual environment management, reproducible builds via lockfile.

## Game Overview

- **Harvest** smiles through clicks and passive collection
