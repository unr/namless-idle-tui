# Dream Weaver

## Theme Overview
Craft and sell dreams in a surreal marketplace where thoughts become tangible. Collect emotional fragments from sleepers, weave them into beautiful or terrifying dreamscapes, and build an empire in the space between waking and sleeping.

## Core Concept
You are a Dream Merchant operating in the collective unconscious. Harvest raw thought-stuff from sleeping minds, refine it into coherent dreams, and sell them to customers seeking specific experiences. Navigate the fuzzy logic of dream-reality where normal rules don't apply.

  "Anxiety Dream: Late for Exam"
  
This dream resonates deeply.

### Dream Logic Events
Random surreal occurrences:

"A door appears where no door should be."
→ Click to explore → Find rare resource or recipe

"The numbers won't add up."
→ Production calculation goes bizarre for 30 sec

"You're late! You're so late!"
→ Anxiety surge → Nightmare production +500%

"This has all happened before..."
→ Déjà vu → Repeat last 60 seconds of production

### REM Cascade
When REM energy hits 90%:
- All production x10 for 30 seconds
- Chance to enter lucid state
- Screen effects intensify
- Can "control" the cascade with upgrades

### Nightmare Redemption
Convert nightmares through therapy:

```
Nightmare → Confront → Process → Integrate → Hope Crystal

[THERAPEUTIC CYCLE]
1. Face the fear (use nightmare fuel)
2. Understand the source (emotional essence)
3. Transform the meaning (alchemy)
4. Harvest hope from resolution
```

### Prophecy Manifestation
High-level prophetic visions sometimes come true:

```
💭 PROPHETIC VISION: "A customer will request [Flying Dream] tomorrow."

[24 hours later]
Customer: "I need a flying dream. I've been told you're the best."
→ Fulfill prophecy → 10x payment bonus
```

### Shadow Self Encounter
At 50 prestiges, meet your Shadow:

```
The Shadow: "I am everything you deny. Everything you repress."

Boss Battle Mechanics:
- Shadow mirrors your moves
- Uses your own nightmares against you
- Must integrate, not destroy
- Victory → Massive permanent bonuses

### Sound Design Ideas
- Whispered fragments for thought collection
- Chimes and bells for memory formation
- Swirling ambient for dream weaving
- Dark bass for nightmares
- Bright tinkles for sweet dreams
- Brainwave tones for REM states
- Ethereal choir for collective unconscious
- Reality-bending effects for lucid states
- Ominous rumble for Shadow encounter
- Triumphant orchestral for Oneiroi council

## Design Philosophy

**Surreal Logic**: Embrace dream physics. Things don't need to make logical sense - they need to make emotional sense.

**Emotional Honesty**: Dreams reveal truth. Don't shy away from darkness or pain - they're part of the human experience.

**Aesthetic Beauty**: Every screen should feel like art. Dream-like visuals, flowing animations, impossible colors.

**Therapeutic Potential**: While a game, respect the power of dreams. Nightmare redemption arc is cathartic by design.

**Mystery and Discovery**: Don't explain everything. Let players discover recipes, unlock secrets, find their own meaning.

**Non-Linear Narrative**: Dream layers and prestige create nested realities. Embrace the confusion and wonder.

## Future Expansion Ideas

- **Shared Dreamscapes**: Multiplayer dream collaboration
- **Dream Interpretation**: Analyze dreams for deeper meaning
- **Nightmare Therapy Minigame**: Help traumatized customers
- **Reality Bleeding**: Dreams affect real world (and vice versa)
- **Historical Dreams**: Dream the dreams of famous people
- **Species Dreams**: What do animals dream?
- **Coma Patients**: High-risk, high-reward dream harvesting
- **Sleep Study**: Research facility management layer
- **Dream Streaming**: Broadcast dreams to audience
- **Inception Heists**: Ocean's Eleven in the dreamscape
