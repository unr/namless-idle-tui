# Emotion Merchant

## Theme Overview
Trade in the economy of feelings. Extract emotions from experiences, refine them into pure essence, combine them in alchemical mixtures, and sell them to customers seeking specific emotional states. Build an empire in the marketplace of human experience.

## Core Concept
In a world where emotions can be bottled and traded, you run an emotion dispensary. Harvest feelings from life experiences, distill them to purity, mix emotional cocktails, and sell them to those who need joy, courage, love, or even controlled doses of sadness. Explore what happens when feelings become commodities.

## Core Mechanics

### Emotional Harvesting
Extract feelings from life experiences:

```
[EXPERIENCE DETECTED: First Kiss]

Available Emotions:
‚ù§ Joy: 85% (dominant)
üíï Love: 60% (strong)
üò∞ Fear: 30% (nervous)
üòä Excitement: 70% (medium)

[HARVEST ALL] - Get mixed emotions
[SELECTIVE HARVEST] - Choose specific emotions
[OBSERVE] - Watch without harvesting (ethical choice)

Harvesting reduces experience intensity for source
Ethical consideration: Should you take people's feelings?
```

### Emotional Alchemy

```
[ALCHEMICAL LABORATORY]

  60% Fear (facing it)

[CRAFT] [SAVE RECIPE] [DISCOVER NEW]
```

```

  - No side effects
  - Premium price

```

### Emotional Contamination
Negative emotions can corrupt positive ones:

```
WARNING: Joy contaminated with Fear!

Pure Joy (100%) + Fear exposure = Anxious Joy (60%)

Contamination spreads:
- Storage vessels leak emotions
- Incompatible emotions clash
- Poor handling reduces purity
- Time degrades unstable mixes

[PURIFICATION PROCESS]: Costs resources but restores purity
[QUARANTINE]: Isolate contaminated stock
[SELL AS-IS]: Cheap but damages reputation
```

### Emotional Addiction
Customers can become dependent:

```
[CUSTOMER #47: Sarah - RETURNING]

"That courage bottle really helped! Can I get more?"

1. SELL AGAIN - Profit now, harm later
2. REFUSE - Lose customer, help long-term
3. THERAPY BLEND - Expensive, reduces dependency
4. TAPER PROTOCOL - Guide her to independence

Ethical weight of your choice...
```

## Design Philosophy

**Emotions as Commerce**: Explore the commodification of feeling. What happens when emotions are bought and sold?

**Ethical Complexity**: No easy answers. Profit vs. helping. Short-term relief vs. long-term wellness.

**Empathy Central**: The game teaches emotional intelligence by making you understand feelings mechanically.

**Addiction Matters**: Take it seriously. Show the real consequences of dependency.

**Color Psychology**: Use color meaningfully. Every emotion has a specific hue that affects the player.

**Warm Capitalism**: It's a business game, but with heart. Can you be profitable and ethical?
