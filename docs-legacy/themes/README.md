## Common Design Principles

All themes share these core idle game pillars:

### Progression Structure
- **Early Game** (0-30 min): Tutorial through discovery, manual clicking important
- **Mid Game** (30 min - 3 hours): Automation kicks in, strategic choices matter
- **Late Game** (3-10 hours): Complex optimization, prestige available
- **Endgame** (10+ hours): Meta-progression, multiple prestige cycles

### Resource Design
- Base clickable resource (manual engagement)
- 8-10 tier resource chain (clear progression)
- 2-4 secondary resources (strategic depth)
- Exponential scaling with meaningful milestones

### Prestige Systems
- Available when reaching final tier or special condition
- Resets resources but grants permanent multipliers
- Unlocks new mechanics and content
- Multiple prestige paths for replayability
- Ultimate victory condition at 500+ prestiges

### UI/UX Considerations
- ASCII art that scales from micro to macro
- Color coding for resource tiers and states
- Real-time animations using terminal characters
- Clear production rates and multiplier displays
- Tooltips and help systems for complexity

### Narrative Integration
- Flavor text that evolves with progression
- Environmental storytelling through mechanics
- Philosophical or thematic depth
- Multiple endings based on player choices
- Achievement system reinforcing theme

## TUI-Specific Design Choices

These themes are optimized for terminal interfaces:

### Visual Language
- **Minimalism**: Work within ASCII/Unicode constraints
- **Symbolic**: Rich use of symbolic characters (‚óâ ‚ñì ‚âã ‚àû)
- **Color**: Strategic use of ANSI colors for emotional impact
- **Animation**: Text-based effects (flickering, flowing, pulsing)

### Information Density
- Dense but readable layouts
- Clear hierarchical organization
- Important metrics always visible
- Expandable detail views (tabbed interfaces)

### Accessibility
- Colorblind-friendly (not color-dependent)
- High contrast options considered
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader compatible structure

### Performance
- Low CPU overhead for idle gameplay
- Efficient rendering of large numbers
- Smooth animations without lag
- Save/load with minimal disk I/O

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Stack (Reference: Current Project)
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **TUI Framework**: Textual (recommended in docs)
- **Data**: Decimal for precise large numbers
- **Storage**: SQLite for save games
- **Async**: For smooth idle calculations

### Architecture Patterns
- **ECS**: Entity-Component-System for game objects
- **State Machine**: For game phases and modes
- **Observer**: For UI updates from game state
- **Command**: For undoable player actions

### Balancing Formulas

Common exponential progressions used across themes:

```python
# Cost scaling
base_cost * (1.15 ^ count)

# Production multipliers  
base_production * (upgrade_multiplier ^ level)

# Prestige currency
log10(total_production) * prestige_count

# Soft caps
production / (1 + production / cap_value)
```
