# Asciimatics - Terminal Animation Framework

## Overview
Asciimatics is a full-featured terminal animation framework for Python that provides high-level APIs for creating ASCII art animations and text UIs.

## Relevance to Our Goals
- **60fps rendering**: Asciimatics has a built-in frame rate control system
- **Sprite animations**: Includes sprite system with collision detection
- **Text effects**: Rich text effects and animations out of the box
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals
- **Scene management**: Built-in scene and screen management

## Key Features
- Effects system for animated sprites and particles
- Built-in widgets for UI elements
- Frame-based animation system
- ASCII art support with image-to-ASCII conversion
- Fire, matrix, and other visual effects

## Code Example
```python
from asciimatics.screen import Screen
from asciimatics.effects import Sprite
from asciimatics.renderers import StaticRenderer

def demo(screen):
    sprites = []
    for i in range(10):
        sprite = Sprite(
            screen,
            renderer=StaticRenderer(images=["O"]),
            x=i * 5,
            y=screen.height // 2,
            colour=Screen.COLOUR_YELLOW
        )
        sprites.append(sprite)
    
    screen.play([sprites], stop_on_resize=True)

Screen.wrapper(demo)
```

## Pros
- Complete animation framework ready to use
- Good performance for terminal animations
- Extensive documentation and examples
- Handles terminal resizing gracefully

## Cons
- May conflict with Textual's event loop
- Not designed specifically for integration with Textual
- Older API design compared to modern TUI frameworks

## Integration Difficulty
**Medium** - Would require wrapping Asciimatics components to work within Textual's widget system.

## Verdict
While Asciimatics is powerful, it might be challenging to integrate with Textual. Consider using its concepts and algorithms rather than the library directly.
