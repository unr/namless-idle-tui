# TCOD (libtcod) - Roguelike Development Library

## Overview
TCOD (The Chronicles of Doryen) is a Python library specifically designed for roguelike game development. It provides terminal emulation, pathfinding, field-of-view calculations, and other roguelike-specific features.

## Relevance to Our Goals
- **Terminal rendering**: Designed for ASCII/Unicode games
- **Performance**: C++ backend for speed
- **Sprite-like entities**: Entity management systems
- **Animation support**: Timer and event systems

## Key Features
- Console rendering with layers
- Pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)
- Field of view calculations
- Noise generation for procedural content
- Image to ASCII conversion

## Code Example
```python
import tcod
import tcod.event

class Entity:
    def __init__(self, x, y, char, color):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.char = char
        self.color = color
        self.vx = 1
        self.vy = 0
        
    def update(self):
        self.x += self.vx
        self.y += self.vy
        
    def draw(self, console):
        console.print(self.x, self.y, self.char, fg=self.color)

def main():
    width, height = 80, 50
    
    # Create console
    with tcod.context.new(
        columns=width,
        rows=height,
        title="Idle Game",
        vsync=True  # Enable 60fps vsync
    ) as context:
        console = tcod.console.Console(width, height, order="F")
        entities = [Entity(10, 10, "@", tcod.yellow)]
        
        while True:
            console.clear()
            
            # Update and draw entities
            for entity in entities:
                entity.update()
                entity.draw(console)
            
            context.present(console)
            
            # Handle events
            for event in tcod.event.wait():
                if isinstance(event, tcod.event.Quit):
                    return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Pros
- Purpose-built for terminal games
- Excellent performance
- Rich feature set for roguelikes
- Good documentation

## Cons
- Creates its own terminal window
- Not compatible with Textual's architecture
- Focused on roguelike-specific features

## Integration Difficulty
**Very High** - TCOD creates its own rendering context and is incompatible with Textual.

## Alternative Use
Could study TCOD's entity management and animation timing systems.

## Verdict
While excellent for standalone roguelikes, TCOD cannot integrate with Textual. Consider it for inspiration only.
