# Blessed - Terminal Capabilities Library

## Overview
Blessed is a Python library that provides advanced terminal control, color support, and keyboard input handling. It's a modern alternative to curses with a cleaner API.

## Relevance to Our Goals
- **Terminal control**: Full control over cursor positioning and colors
- **Animation support**: Can create smooth animations with proper timing
- **Input handling**: Advanced keyboard and mouse input
- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across different terminals

## Key Features
- Terminal capability detection
- 256-color and true color support
- Non-blocking keyboard input
- Cursor positioning and hiding
- Terminal size detection

## Code Example
```python
from blessed import Terminal
import time

term = Terminal()

with term.fullscreen(), term.hidden_cursor():
    # Bouncing ball animation
    x, y = 0, 0
    dx, dy = 1, 1
    
    while True:
        # Clear previous position
        print(term.move(y, x) + ' ')
        
        # Update position
        x += dx
        y += dy
        
        # Bounce off walls
        if x >= term.width - 1 or x <= 0:
            dx = -dx
        if y >= term.height - 1 or y <= 0:
            dy = -dy
        
        # Draw at new position
        print(term.move(y, x) + 'O')
        
        time.sleep(0.016)  # ~60fps
```

## Pros
- Lightweight and fast
- Clean, Pythonic API
- Excellent terminal capabilities detection
- Can be used alongside other libraries

## Cons
- Lower level than Textual - requires more manual work
- No built-in widget system
- Would need to rebuild many features Textual provides

## Integration Difficulty
**High** - Blessed operates at a lower level than Textual and would conflict with Textual's terminal control.

## Alternative Use
Could potentially use Blessed's terminal capability detection to optimize our Textual rendering.

## Verdict
While powerful, Blessed conflicts with Textual's architecture. Better to use Textual's built-in capabilities.
