# TUI Incremental/Idle Game Tech Stack Investigation

## Requirements Summary
- Build an incremental/idle game with menus, graphs, and ASCII art
- True TUI interface that can also deploy to web
- High performance (handling extremely large numbers with rapid updates)
- Series of menus/graphs/ASCII art interface

---

## Tech Stack Options

### 1. **Textual (Python) ⭐ RECOMMENDED FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT**

**What it is:** A modern Python framework for building TUI apps that can run in terminal AND web browser via WebAssembly.

**Why it's great for your use case:**
- ✅ **TUI + Web out of the box** - Deploy same codebase to terminal AND web (via textual-web)
- ✅ **Rich widget system** - Built-in support for tables, charts, progress bars, trees
- ✅ **CSS-like styling** - Familiar theming system for terminal UIs
- ✅ **Reactive/declarative** - Modern app architecture similar to React
- ✅ **Excellent documentation** - Well-maintained with great examples
- ✅ **Fast development** - Python means rapid prototyping

**Performance considerations:**
- ⚠️ Python is slower than Rust/Go, but for a TUI with menus/graphs, the bottleneck is usually rendering, not computation
- ✅ Can use NumPy/C extensions for heavy number crunching if needed
- ✅ Async support means UI stays responsive even during heavy calculations

**Example code structure:**
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import DataTable, Sparkline

class IdleGame(App):
    def compose(self):
        yield DataTable()  # For stats
        yield Sparkline()  # For graphs
```

**Deployment:**
- Terminal: Native Python execution
- Web: Use `textual-web` package to serve via WebSocket

**Best for:** Fastest time-to-market, rich built-in widgets, proven web deployment

---

### 2. **Ratatui (Rust)**

**What it is:** High-performance Rust TUI framework, the most popular terminal UI library in Rust ecosystem.

**Why it's great for your use case:**
- ✅ **Blazing fast** - Rust performance means handling massive numbers/updates efficiently
- ✅ **Rich widget ecosystem** - Charts, tables, graphs, gauges all available
- ✅ **Memory safe** - Rust's guarantees prevent crashes during long idle sessions
- ✅ **Large community** - 15.6k stars, actively maintained, tons of examples
- ✅ **Crossterm/Termion backends** - Cross-platform terminal support

**Performance considerations:**
- ✅ Best-in-class performance for number crunching
- ✅ Zero-cost abstractions
- ✅ Can easily handle millions of operations per second

**Web deployment challenge:**
- ❌ **No native web support** - Unlike Textual, Ratatui is terminal-only
- ⚠️ Would need to:
  - Compile to WASM and build custom terminal emulator in browser (complex)
  - OR build separate web frontend that talks to Rust backend (two codebases)
  - OR use something like `xterm.js` + WASM (experimental, significant work)

**Example code structure:**
```rust
use ratatui::{
    widgets::{Block, Borders, Gauge, BarChart},
    Terminal,
};

fn ui(f: &mut Frame, app: &App) {
    let chunks = Layout::default()
        .constraints([Constraint::Percentage(50), Constraint::Percentage(50)])
        .split(f.size());
    
    f.render_widget(Gauge::default().percent(app.progress), chunks[0]);
    f.render_widget(BarChart::default().data(&app.data), chunks[1]);
}
```

**Best for:** Maximum performance, Rust ecosystem integration, terminal-only deployment acceptable

---

### 3. **Bubble Tea (Go)**

**What it is:** Go framework based on The Elm Architecture, similar design to Textual/Ratatui but in Go.

**Why it's great for your use case:**
- ✅ **Clean architecture** - Elm Architecture pattern makes state management elegant
- ✅ **Good performance** - Go's goroutines excellent for background calculations
- ✅ **Simple deployment** - Single binary, cross-platform
- ✅ **Growing ecosystem** - "Bubbles" library has common components
- ✅ **Easier than Rust** - Simpler learning curve than Rust

**Performance considerations:**
- ✅ Very fast, though not quite Rust-level
- ✅ Garbage collector handles memory management
- ✅ Goroutines make idle/background tasks trivial

**Web deployment challenge:**
- ❌ **No native web support** - Terminal-only like Ratatui
- ⚠️ Would need GopherJS/WASM conversion (immature ecosystem)
- ⚠️ OR separate web frontend

**Example code structure:**
```go
type model struct {
    progress int
    resources map[string]int64
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    // Handle keypresses, timers, etc.
}

func (m model) View() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Resources: %d\nProgress: %d%%", 
        m.resources, m.progress)
}
```

**Best for:** Balance of performance and simplicity, prefer Go over Rust/Python

---

### 4. **Ink (Node.js/React)**

**What it is:** React for CLIs - build terminal interfaces using React components and JSX.

**Why it's great for your use case:**
- ✅ **React paradigm** - If you know React, you already know Ink
- ✅ **Component reusability** - Build complex UIs from composable components
- ✅ **Rich ecosystem** - npm packages for charts, spinners, inputs
- ✅ **Hot reloading** - Fast development iteration
- ✅ **Potential web bridge** - React components could theoretically be adapted

**Performance considerations:**
- ⚠️ Node.js performance adequate but not exceptional
- ⚠️ V8 engine handles large numbers well but slower than compiled languages
- ✅ Can use native modules for heavy computation

**Web deployment:**
- ⚠️ **No official web support** - Terminal-only
- ✅ But easier path than Go/Rust since it's already JavaScript
- ✅ Could potentially share React components between terminal and web builds

**Example code structure:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {render, Box, Text} from 'ink';

const IdleGame = () => {
    const [gold, setGold] = useState(0);
    
    return (
        <Box flexDirection="column">
            <Text>Gold: {gold}</Text>
            <Text>Press space to collect</Text>
        </Box>
    );
};

render(<IdleGame />);
```

**Best for:** React developers, rapid prototyping, component-based architecture

---

### 5. **Hybrid Approach: Rust Core + Web Assembly + Terminal Frontend**

**What it is:** Write game logic in Rust, compile to both native binary (for terminal) AND WASM (for web).

**Architecture:**
```
[Rust Game Engine Core] 
        ↓
    ┌───────┴────────┐
    ↓                ↓
[Ratatui TUI]   [WASM + HTML Canvas/Terminal Emulator]
```

**Why it's great for your use case:**
- ✅ **Maximum performance** - Rust handles the big number computations
- ✅ **Code sharing** - Game logic written once, used everywhere
- ✅ **Best of both worlds** - Native terminal experience + web deployment
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Can add more frontends later (GUI, mobile, etc.)

**Implementation strategy:**
1. Write game engine as library crate with no UI dependencies
2. Create terminal frontend using Ratatui that imports the engine
3. Create web frontend that compiles engine to WASM
4. Use `xterm.js` or similar for web-based terminal emulation

**Performance considerations:**
- ✅ Peak performance for calculations
- ✅ WASM performance nearly native
- ✅ Can use web workers for background tasks

**Complexity trade-off:**
- ⚠️ More complex architecture
- ⚠️ Two frontends to maintain (though shared core)
- ⚠️ Requires WASM tooling knowledge

**Example structure:**
```
idle-game/
├── engine/          # Pure Rust game logic
│   ├── src/
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── terminal-ui/     # Ratatui frontend
│   ├── src/
│   └── Cargo.toml
└── web-ui/          # WASM + JS frontend
    ├── src/
    ├── www/
    └── Cargo.toml
```

**Best for:** Long-term project, want maximum performance AND multi-platform support

## My Recommendation: Textual

For your specific use case (incremental idle game with TUI+web requirement), I recommend **Textual** because:

1. **You explicitly need web deployment** - Textual is the only option with built-in, production-ready web support
2. **Menus/graphs/ASCII art** - Textual excels at this with built-in widgets
3. **Development speed** - Python means faster iteration on game mechanics
4. **Performance is sufficient** - For a menu-driven idle game, Python performance is adequate. The bottleneck will be rendering, not computation
5. **If you need more performance later** - You can always rewrite the calculation engine in Rust/C and call it from Python

### Quick Start with Textual:
```bash
pip install textual textual-dev
textual wizard my-idle-game
cd my-idle-game
textual run --dev app.py  # Live reload during dev
```

### For Web Deployment:
```bash
pip install textual-web
textual-web  # Serves your app over WebSocket
```

The only reason NOT to choose Textual would be if:
- You absolutely need maximum performance (use Rust hybrid approach)
- You're already heavily invested in Rust/Go ecosystem
- You want to learn systems programming (great excuse to use Rust!)

## Final Answer: Are There Other Options?

**After extensive research, Textual is currently the ONLY mature, production-ready framework that provides TRUE TUI+web deployment from a single codebase.**

Other approaches exist but have significant limitations:

### What About "TUI via SSH in Browser"?
- **Charm Wish** (Go) - Serves Bubble Tea apps over SSH, accessible via browser SSH clients
  - ⚠️ Not true web deployment - requires SSH client
  - ⚠️ Users must connect via SSH (wssh, ttyd, etc.)
  - ⚠️ More complex setup than pure web

### What About Progressive Web Apps?
- **go-app** (Go + WASM) - Build PWAs with Go
  - ❌ Not a TUI framework - builds GUI web apps, not terminal interfaces
  - Different use case entirely

### The Hard Truth

If you need:
1. ✅ Real TUI interface (terminal styling, ASCII art, text-based UI)
2. ✅ Web deployment (accessible via browser without SSH)
3. ✅ Single codebase (not maintaining two separate apps)

**Then Textual is your only battle-tested option.**

### Alternative Architectures (Not Single Codebase)

If you're willing to compromise on "single codebase," you have options:

#### Option A: Shared Core + Dual Frontends
```
Game Engine (Rust/Go/Python)
    ├── TUI Frontend (Ratatui/Bubble Tea/Blessed)
    └── Web Frontend (React/Vue/Vanilla JS)
```
- ✅ Share game logic
- ❌ Maintain two separate UI codebases
- ⚠️ API/IPC layer needed between engine and frontends

#### Option B: TUI Over Network Protocol
```
TUI Server (Ratatui/Bubble Tea) → Browser Terminal Emulator (xterm.js)
```
- ✅ Real TUI rendering
- ❌ Requires WebSocket/Server infrastructure
- ❌ No offline support
- ⚠️ Similar to SSH approach but custom protocol

### Why Isn't This More Common?

The TUI+web use case is niche because:
1. Most terminal apps don't need web deployment
2. Most web apps don't benefit from TUI aesthetics
3. Terminal rendering in browsers is complex (charset, colors, layouts)
4. Textual solved this with significant engineering effort (textual-web)

### Emerging/Experimental Options

**None are production-ready as of October 2024:**

- **Rust TUI + wasm-terminal** - Experimental, no frameworks support this
- **Go TUI + GopherJS** - Go→JS transpilation doesn't support TUI libraries
- **Blessed-contrib** (Node.js) - TUI library, but no web compilation path

---

## Updated Recommendation

Given your **hard requirement** for TUI+web from single codebase:

### 🥇 **Use Textual** (No Real Alternative)

It's not just recommended—it's currently the only viable option that meets ALL your requirements:
- ✅ True TUI interface
- ✅ Web deployment
- ✅ Single codebase
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Actively maintained

### If You're Willing to Compromise:

**Compromise on "single codebase"** → Use Hybrid Approach:
- Rust/Go game engine
- Ratatui/Bubble Tea for terminal
- React/Vue for web
- Share game logic via WASM or API

**Compromise on "true TUI"** → Use go-app or similar:
- Build a GUI web app styled to look terminal-like
- Deploy as PWA
- No real terminal version, just web

**Compromise on "web deployment"** → Use Ratatui/Bubble Tea:
- Terminal-only
- Users SSH to play (via ttyd, wssh)
- Great performance but more setup for users
