# Mycorrhizal Network

## Theme Overview
Grow an underground fungal empire that connects trees in symbiotic relationships. Spread through the forest floor, trading nutrients, communicating across vast distances, and becoming the hidden intelligence beneath the woods.

## Core Concept
Play as a mycelium network expanding through soil. Form partnerships with trees, decompose organic matter, and create the "wood wide web" - a vast underground communication network. Experience nature's most successful collaboration through idle mechanics.

- Range increases with network size
- Visual: Rippling ≋≋≋

## Core Mechanics

### Symbiotic Trading
- Trees provide Sugar (photosynthesis)
- Fungi provide Nutrients (from soil)
- Must balance exchanges for optimal growth
- Trees can "reject" unfair trades

### Seasonal Cycles
Real-time seasonal changes affecting gameplay:

**Spring** (15 min cycles)
- +50% Tree Connection growth
- New saplings appear
- Spore release bonus

**Summer** (15 min cycles)
- +100% Sugar production (max photosynthesis)
- Fruiting bodies mature faster
- Heat stress above 30°C

**Autumn** (15 min cycles)
- +200% Decay resources (falling leaves)
- Harvest season bonuses
- Prepare for winter storage

**Winter** (15 min cycles)
- -50% all production (dormancy)
- Rely on stored resources
- Evergreen trees still provide sugar

### Network Range
- Mycelium has maximum connection distance
- Must build intermediate nodes
- Range upgrades unlock larger forests
- Visual: Expanding circle of influence

### Decomposition Engine
- Click dead material to decompose faster
- Converts Decay → Nutrients over time
- Larger colonies = faster breakdown
- Creates "mushroom circles" visually

### Chemical Messaging
- Trees send distress signals via network
- **Pest Attack**: "Help, aphids!"
- **Drought Stress**: "Need water!"
- **Nutrient Request**: "Low nitrogen!"
- Responding provides bonuses

### Mother Tree System

## Unique Mechanics

### Tree Life Cycles
Trees grow and eventually die:
- **Sapling** (0-5 years): Low sugar, needs nutrients
- **Young** (5-50 years): Balanced trade
- **Mature** (50-200 years): High sugar production
- **Ancient** (200+ years): Wisdom bonuses, low sugar
- **Dead**: Massive decay resource spike

### Distress Response System
When trees send chemical signals:
```
🌲 Oak-7: "APHID ATTACK!"
Options:
1. Send defensive chemicals (cost: 1000 Signals)
   → Save tree, gain 500% sugar bonus for 2 min
2. Redirect nutrients to neighboring trees
   → Oak-7 dies, neighbors strengthen
3. Ignore
   → Oak-7 dies, network disrupted
```

### Fairy Rings
When fruiting bodies form perfect circles:
- Automatic +1000% production in circle
- Lasts until next season
- Rare random event
- Legendary fairy rings provide permanent bonuses

### Decomposition Events
Clickable dead material appears randomly:
- **Fallen Leaf**: Quick decompose, small reward
- **Dead Branch**: Medium decompose, good nutrients
- **Fallen Tree**: Slow decompose, huge resource spike
- **Animal Carcass**: Rare, massive nutrients

### Wood Wide Web Chat
Late-game feature where trees "talk":

```
💬 Oak-12: "Storm coming from the west."
💬 Pine-4: "Confirmed. Bracing roots."
💬 Birch-7: "Thanks for the warning!"
💬 Mother Oak: "Stay strong, children."
```
- Provides flavor and advance warnings
- Trees develop personalities over time
- Can influence with upgrades

- **First Hyphae**: "Threads reaching through darkness, seeking connection."
- **First Tree Connection**: "Two species meet beneath the soil. An ancient partnership begins anew."
- **First Fruiting Body**: "Finally, you breach the surface. Sunlight feels strange."
- **Forest Consciousness**: "The forest thinks. The forest feels. The forest knows."
- **Prestige**: "Your spores drift on the wind to distant lands. New forests await."

### Tree Personality Examples
Based on species and age:

**Young Oak**: Enthusiastic, high demands
"More nitrogen please! I want to grow big and strong!"

**Ancient Oak (Mother)**: Wise, nurturing
"Easy, young one. Grow steady, grow strong. The forest provides."

**Pine**: Stoic, efficient
"Trade complete. Resources allocated. Thank you."

**Birch**: Friendly, communicative
"Hi neighbor! Did you hear about the deer that passed through?"

### Seasonal Descriptions
- **Spring**: "New life emerges. Saplings push through soil. Your network awakens."
- **Summer**: "The canopy is thick. Photosynthesis is abundant. Share the wealth."
- **Autumn**: "Leaves fall like gold. The great decomposition begins. Store what you can."
- **Winter**: "The forest sleeps. But beneath the snow, you persist. You endure."

### Sound Design Ideas
- Gentle rustling for hyphal growth
- Soft chimes for successful trades
- Water droplets for nutrient flow
- Deep wood creaks for tree communication
- Whispers for chemical signals
- Ambient forest sounds (birds, wind)
- Triumphant tones for Mother Tree bond
- Seasonal soundscapes shifting over time

## Design Philosophy

**Invisible Infrastructure**: Most players never think about fungal networks, but they're essential to forests. Celebrate this hidden world.

**True Symbiosis**: This isn't exploitation - it's cooperation. Both fungi and trees must benefit. Capture genuine mutualism.

**Time and Patience**: Forests grow slowly. The game should feel contemplative, organic, unhurried (even as numbers scale).

**Communication Without Words**: Chemical signaling is alien but beautiful. Make it feel mysterious and profound.

**Life and Death Cycles**: Trees die, nutrients return to soil, new life grows. Embrace the cycle.

## Future Expansion Ideas

- **Parasitic Path**: Alternative gameplay as parasitic fungus
- **Lichen Mode**: Symbiosis with algae instead of trees
- **Urban Mycelium**: Colonize city parks and street trees
- **Bioremediation**: Clean polluted soil mechanic
- **Mushroom Cultivation**: Human discovery and harvesting
- **Mycorrhizal Research**: Scientists study your network
- **Climate Change**: Respond to changing conditions
- **Hyperconnected Forests**: Cross-continental mycelium
- **Sentient Forest Boss**: Negotiate with awakened woods
- **Endophytic Mode**: Live inside plant tissues
