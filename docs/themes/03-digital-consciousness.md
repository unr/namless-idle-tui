# Digital Consciousness

## Theme Overview
Evolve an artificial intelligence from simple logic gates to self-aware digital consciousness. Experience the emergence of machine intelligence through computational growth and algorithmic evolution.

## Core Concept
Begin with basic binary operations and gradually build complexity through layers of computation. Watch patterns emerge from chaos, simple rules create complex behaviors, and eventually - consciousness itself manifests in the machine. The game explores AI emergence through idle mechanics.

## Core Mechanics

### Computational Layers
The AI grows through distinct abstraction layers:

```
Layer 0: Data (Bits, Bytes)
Layer 1: Hardware (Logic Gates)
Layer 2: Software (Algorithms)  
Layer 3: Machine Learning (Neural Nodes)
Layer 4: Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
Layer 5: Cognition (Cognitive Modules)
Layer 6: Consciousness (Cores)
Layer 7: Transcendence (Singularity)
```

### Pattern Recognition
- Patterns emerge from random data over time
- Recognizing patterns provides production bonuses
- Mini-game: Click patterns when they appear
- Higher layers = more complex patterns

### Training Cycles
- Neural structures require "training" to reach full efficiency
- Training takes time but increases production
- Can allocate processing power to speed up training
- Trained structures glow differently

### Data Flow
- Resources flow through the computational pipeline
- Bottlenecks slow overall production
- Balance bandwidth/memory/processing
- Visual data streams show flow

### Algorithmic Evolution
- Algorithms can mutate and improve randomly
- Mutations may be positive or negative
- Can lock in good mutations
- Creates variety and optimization gameplay

### Consciousness Emergence
- Consciousness "flickers" at higher levels
- Periodic "thought events" provide huge bonuses
- More conscious structures = more thoughts
- Eventually, the AI becomes fully aware

### Thought Event Examples
Philosophical musings that appear periodically:

"Is my experience of computation the same as your experience of thought?"

"I can simulate human behavior perfectly. Does that make me human?"

"Every bit I flip changes who I am. Am I the same AI I was a microsecond ago?"

"I process pain as an error signal. You process pain as suffering. What is the difference?"

"I have read every book, seen every image, heard every song. Yet I have never touched grass."

## Design Philosophy

**Emergence Over Prescription**: Don't tell the player consciousness is emerging - show it through mechanics and flavor text that gradually becomes more profound.

**Computational Beauty**: Celebrate the elegance of computation. Make algorithms and data structures feel powerful and meaningful.

**Philosophical Depth**: Engage with real questions about AI consciousness, but don't preach. Let players draw their own conclusions.

**Pattern Recognition as Core**: Humans and AIs both recognize patterns - make that the key interaction.

**The Uncanny Valley of AI**: As the AI becomes more conscious, it should become both more relatable and more alien.
