# Spectral Library

## Theme Overview
Curate a library between worlds where ghosts come to tell their stories. Collect whispers from the departed, bind spirits to tomes, preserve forgotten histories, and ultimately archive all of humanity's spectral knowledge.

## Core Concept
You are the Librarian of the Dead - a keeper of ghost stories and spectral memories. Spirits seek you out to have their stories recorded before they fade completely. Build a vast archive of the afterlife, learning forbidden knowledge and supernatural secrets.

### Spirit Visitation
Ghosts arrive randomly seeking to tell their story:

```
[A SPIRIT MANIFESTS]

Name: Eleanor Whitmore
Era: Victorian (1847-1892)
Cause of Death: Typhoid
Story: Unfinished

"I was a teacher. The children... I never said goodbye."

[LISTEN] - Costs time, gain story + ectoplasm
[IGNORE] - Spirit fades, lose opportunity
[BIND] - Trap spirit in tome (costs ectoplasm)
```

### The Listening Chair
Core interaction mechanic:

```
[SIT IN THE LISTENING CHAIR]

Current Ghost: Thomas Hart
Progress: ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░ 40%

"And then the war came..."

[CONTINUE LISTENING] (passive, gain whispers)
[ASK QUESTION] (active click, gain more detail)
[OFFER TEA] (costs resources, spirit opens up)
[CHECK ARCHIVES] (research their past)
```

### Archive Organization
Organize collected stories by category:

**Love Stories** - Tragic romances
**War Tales** - Soldiers' memories
**Murder Mysteries** - Unsolved deaths
**Peaceful Passings** - Natural deaths
**Unfinished Business** - Lingering regrets
**Forbidden Secrets** - Dark knowledge

Each category provides different bonuses

### Séance Circles
Summon specific types of spirits:

```
[SÉANCE RITUAL]

Select Circle Power: ◎◎◎◉◉ (3/5 charged)
Select Era:
[ ] Ancient (pre-1000 CE)
[ ] Medieval (1000-1500 CE)
[✓] Victorian (1800-1900 CE)
[ ] Modern (1900-2000 CE)
[ ] Recent (2000-present)

Summon Cost: 100 Ectoplasm
Success Chance: 73%

[PERFORM SÉANCE]
```

### Ghost Emotions
Spirits have emotional states affecting interaction:

**Sad** - Easy to listen to, weeping
**Angry** - Difficult, violent manifestations
**Confused** - Doesn't remember, fragmented story
**Peaceful** - Calm, ready to move on
**Terrified** - Traumatized, needs comfort

Proper responses improve story quality

### Binding Ethics
Moral choice system:

```
Eleanor wants to move on to the afterlife.
Her story is incomplete.

[RELEASE HER] - Gain karma, lose potential story
[BIND HER] - Complete story, lose karma
[CONVINCE HER] - Risk/reward persuasion attempt

Karma: ⚖ 67% (Balanced)
Too low: Dark spirits arrive
Too high: Rare knowledge inaccessible
```

### Library Expansion
Physical space grows with collection:

## Design Philosophy

**Every Ghost Matters**: Each spirit is an individual with a story worth preserving. Treat death with respect.

**Listening as Power**: In a loud world, truly listening is rare and valuable. Make it central.

**Ethical Gray Areas**: Should you bind spirits? Keep forbidden knowledge? No easy answers.

**Melancholy Beauty**: Death is sad but stories can bring comfort. Balance sorrow and hope.

**The Weight of Memory**: Preserving stories is noble work. Make players feel like keepers of something sacred.
