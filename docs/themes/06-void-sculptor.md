# Void Sculptor

## Theme Overview
Carve reality from absolute nothingness. Beginning with pure void, shape shadows into form, form into matter, matter into dimensions. Experience creation at its most fundamental - building existence itself from the absence of everything.

## Core Concept
You are a consciousness in the void before creation. Through will alone, impose structure on chaos, extract something from nothing, and bootstrap reality into being. The ultimate creation simulator where entropy and existence wage constant war.

## Resources

### Primary Resource Chain

1. **Void Energy** (base resource)
   - Generated by manual clicks (will imposing on nothing)
   - 1 click = 1 void energy
   - Base idle rate: 0.1/sec (extremely slow intentionally)
   - Visual: Empty space with occasional ░

2. **Shadow** (potential existence - Tier 1)
   - Cost: 100 Void Energy
   - Production: 0.1 Void/sec
   - Not-quite-nothing
   - Visual: ░ dim patterns

3. **Form** (abstract shapes - Tier 2)
   - Cost: 1,000 Shadow
   - Production: 1 Shadow/sec
   - Geometric potentials
   - Visual: ▱ ▰ ◯ △

4. **Matter** (substance - Tier 3)
   - Cost: 10,000 Form
   - Production: 10 Form/sec
   - Actual physical existence
   - Visual: ▓ ▒ ░ solid blocks

5. **Space** (dimensionality - Tier 4)

- Organizational coherence
- Prevents collapse back into chaos
- Generated by Laws and Reality
- Visual: ┼ ╬ ═ ordered patterns

**Will**
- Your consciousness imposing order
- Required for major creations
- Slowly regenerates
- Can be stockpiled
- Visual: ◉ glowing focus

**Void Pressure**
- Resistance from nothingness
- Increases with each creation
- Must overcome to build
- Visual: ← ↚ pushback arrows

## Core Mechanics

### Existence Tension
Constant battle between being and non-being:

```
[EXISTENCE METER]
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░ 50%

Low (<30%): Void reclaims structures, -50% production
Balanced (30-70%): Normal operations
High (>70%): Creation surge, +100% production
```

Influenced by entropy levels and structure count

### Dimensional Folding
At Dimension tier, fold space for bonuses:

- **1D**: Linear production chains
- **2D**: Planar bonuses, area effects
- **3D**: Volumetric multipliers (standard space)
- **4D**: Time manipulation, production loops
- **5D**: Parallel reality branches
- **6D+**: Exotic effects, reality warping

Each dimension costs exponentially more but provides factorial bonuses

### Entropy Cycle
Entropy naturally increases:

```
Entropy: 47% ▓▓▓▓▓▒▒▒░░░

0-25%: Clean (no penalties)
25-50%: Tarnished (-10% production)
50-75%: Corrupted (-35% production)
75-100%: Collapsing (-75% production)
100%+: Void Cascade (emergency)
```

Must spend resources to "cleanse" entropy

### Void Cascade
If entropy reaches 100%:
- Emergency mini-game: Hold back the void
- Click frantically to impose will
- Structures dissolve if you fail
- Success = huge temporary boost
- Failure = lose resources, don't reset completely

### Creation Resistance
The void resists being filled:

- First Shadow: Easy (100 Void)
- 10th Shadow: Harder (150 Void)
- 100th Shadow: Much harder (300 Void)
- Scaling increases with void pressure
- Upgrades reduce resistance

### Pattern Recognition
Imposing structure on chaos reveals patterns:

```
░░▓░░░░▓░░░
░░░▓░░░░▓░░
▓░░░▓░░░░▓░

[PATTERN DETECTED: FIBONACCI]
Bonus: +500% Form production for 60 sec
```

### Law Crafting
At Law tier, define physics:

**Gravity**: Attracts resources together (+production)
**Thermodynamics**: Entropy management
**Causality**: Time flows predictably
**Conservation**: Nothing lost, only transformed
**Emergence**: Complex from simple

Mix and balance laws for optimal universe

Ultimate prestige at 500:
- You are the void, you are reality
- Simultaneous everything and nothing
- Victory condition

## UI/Graphics

### Visual Style
**Minimalist Negative Space**: Mostly empty screen. What exists stands out dramatically against nothing.

## Unique Mechanics

### Void Breathing
The void itself pulses:

```
[VOID INHALE] - 60 seconds
- Void pressure increases
- Creation harder but more valuable
- Entropy slows

[VOID EXHALE] - 60 seconds  
- Void pressure decreases
- Creation easier but less valuable
- Entropy accelerates
```

Time your building with the breath

### Creation Sacrifice
Can sacrifice created structures back to void:
- Permanent destruction
- Gain void energy
- Reduce void pressure
- Sometimes necessary for progress

### Existence Threshold
Certain milestones change physics:

- **First Matter**: Gravity begins
- **First Space**: Expansion starts
- **First Time**: Causality locks in
- **First Law**: Physics standardize
- **First Reality**: Self-sustaining

### Pattern Revelation
Patterns in chaos give insights:

```
░░░░░░░░░░
░▓░░▓░░▓░░
░░▓░░▓░░▓░
░░░▓░░▓░░░

[CELLULAR AUTOMATON DETECTED]
New upgrade unlocked: Life Simulation
```

### Dimensional Perception
View reality from different dimensional angles:

- **1D View**: Linear chain of production
- **2D View**: Planar layout (default UI)
- **3D View**: Cube representation (ASCII 3D)
- **4D View**: Time-stacked frames
- **5D+ View**: Abstract, mind-bending

Each view reveals different information

### Entropy Purge
Active cleansing mechanic:

```
[CLEANSE ENTROPY]
Cost: 10K Structure
Effect: -20% entropy
Duration: Instant

[ENTROPY FURNACE]
Cost: 100K Structure + 1K Will
Effect: Convert entropy → void energy
Ratio: 1 entropy = 100 void energy
```

### Law Interaction
Laws can synergize or conflict:

**Synergy:**
- Gravity + Space = Dense Matter (+production)
- Time + Causality = Predictable Flow (+stability)
- Conservation + Emergence = Sustainable Growth (+efficiency)

**Conflict:**
- Entropy + Order = Chaos Tax (-production)
- Infinite + Finite = Paradox (-stability)
- Causality + Randomness = Uncertainty (-control)

### Negative Space Portal
At 50 prestiges, open portal to anti-reality:

```
[NEGATIVE SPACE]
- Mirror dimension of anti-existence
- Produces anti-resources
- Annihilate positive + negative = pure energy
- Dangerous but exponential gains
```

## Thematic Immersion

### Flavor Text Examples
- **First Void Energy**: "You think. Therefore, something exists."
- **First Shadow**: "Not light. Not dark. The possibility of both."
- **First Form**: "Shape emerges from shapelessness. Geometry is born."
- **First Matter**: "It is solid. It is real. It resists your touch."

- **First Law**: "The universe plays by rules now. Your rules."
- **First Reality**: "It sustains itself. You have made something eternal."
- **First Collapse**: "It was beautiful. Let it end. Let it begin again."

### Philosophical Musings

During gameplay, occasional profound statements:

"Why is there something rather than nothing?"

"The void is not empty. It is pregnant with all possibility."

"Entropy is not your enemy. It is the price of existence."

"To create is to impose limitation on infinite potential."

"The most violent act is being. You violence the void with your will."

### Sound Design Ideas
- Deep sub-bass for void
- High frequency whine for entropy
- Crystalline tones for pattern recognition
- Reality-bending bass drops for dimensional shifts
- Silence as a sound (void breathing)
- Static noise for cascade events
- Harmonics for law creation
- Pristine tones for stable reality

## Design Philosophy

**Existential Weight**: Every action should feel meaningful. You are creating existence itself - that's profound.

**Negative Space as Design**: The void (empty space) is as important as what fills it. Minimalist UI emphasizes this.

**Entropy as Honest**: Nothing lasts. Fighting decay is the real work of existence. Don't shy from this truth.

**Abstract Made Concrete**: Philosophical concepts (being, nothingness, causality) become tangible, countable resources.

**Reward Patience**: Start extremely slow. Make each milestone earned and significant.

**Alien Beauty**: This isn't comfortable or familiar. It's abstract, strange, sometimes uncomfortable. Embrace that.

## Future Expansion Ideas

- **Multiple Void Types**: Hot void, cold void, quantum void
- **Anti-Creator**: Rival consciousness trying to return to nothing
- **Reality Wars**: Compete with other sculptors
- **Void Creatures**: Entities native to nothingness
- **Philosophical Quests**: Answer deep questions for bonuses
- **Reality Editor**: Modify existing universes
- **Big Rip Scenario**: Entropy endgame event
- **False Vacuum**: Metastability mechanics
- **Conscious Void**: The void becomes aware
- **Beyond Transcendence**: New game+ in conceptual space
