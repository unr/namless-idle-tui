## Detailed Analysis

### Option 1: Pure Textual Canvas Widget ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Best for:** Your exact use case - incremental game with sprite-based animations

#### Strengths
- Native Textual `render_line()` API - no abstraction overhead
- Can handle 1000+ sprites at 60fps
- Direct pixel-level control
- Easy to add complex sprite systems later
- No external dependencies
- Works perfectly with Textual's reactive system
- Future-proof for game expansion

#### Weaknesses
- Must implement sprite physics manually
- More boilerplate than Option 2
- No built-in easing functions (but easy to add)

#### Code Sample
```python
class GameCanvas(Widget):
    def render_line(self, y: int) -> Strip:
        # Direct control over every character
        chars = [' '] * self.size.width
        for sprite in self.sprites:
            if sprite.y == y:
                chars[sprite.x] = sprite.char
        return Strip([Segment(''.join(chars))])
```

#### Verdict
✅ **Perfect fit for your requirements**. Provides the performance and control you need without unnecessary complexity.

### Option 2: Textual + Rich Animations

**Best for:** Simple UI animations, quick prototypes

#### Strengths
- Fastest to implement (1-2 days)
- Smooth animations with built-in easing
- Declarative API - less code
- Beautiful Rich renderables
- CSS integration

#### Weaknesses
- Performance degrades with 50+ concurrent animations
- Limited to CSS property animations
- Can't do complex physics (gravity, collisions)
- Widget mounting/unmounting overhead
- Not suitable for sprite-heavy games

#### Code Sample
```python
class AnimatedNumber(Static):
    def on_mount(self) -> None:
        # Declarative animation
        self.styles.animate("offset_y", value=-10, duration=2.0)
        self.styles.animate("opacity", value=0.0, duration=2.0)
```

#### Verdict
❌ **Not recommended** for your use case. While easiest to implement, performance limitations make it unsuitable for a game that will scale.

---

### Option 3: Async Game Loop with Double Buffering

**Best for:** Complex games with physics engines (platformers, action games)

#### Strengths
- Professional game engine architecture
- True fixed-timestep physics
- Smooth interpolated rendering
- Deterministic and testable
- Scales to very complex games
- Industry-standard patterns

#### Weaknesses
- Massive overkill for incremental game
- 2+ weeks implementation time
- Complex to debug
- More memory (double buffering)
- Requires deep game engine knowledge

#### Code Sample
```python
class GameLoop:
    async def run(self) -> None:
        while self.running:
            # Fixed timestep with interpolation
            while accumulator >= dt:
                self.update(dt)
                accumulator -= dt
            self.render(accumulator / dt)
```

#### Verdict
❌ **Overkill**. This is like using Unity for a clicker game. Only use if you plan to build a full physics-based game.

- Day 4: Testing + optimization
- **Total: 1 week**

**Next Steps:**
1. Read `/docs/game-engine/option1-textual-canvas/README.md`
2. Follow `/docs/game-engine/option1-textual-canvas/implementation.md`
3. Start with `GameCanvas` widget and `Sprite` class
4. Integrate with existing `GameState`
5. Test with bouncing number animation

## Migration Path

If you start with Option 2 (quick prototype) and need to scale:
```
Option 2 → Option 1: 2 days effort
Option 2 → Option 3: 1 week effort
Option 1 → Option 3: 3 days effort (if needed)
```

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before choosing, answer these:

1. **Will you have 100+ simultaneous animations?**
   - Yes → Option 1 or 3
   - No → Option 2 is fine

2. **Do you need physics (gravity, collisions)?**
   - Yes → Option 1 or 3
   - No → Option 2 is fine

3. **Is this a quick prototype or long-term project?**
   - Prototype → Option 2
   - Long-term → Option 1

4. **Will the game expand beyond incremental mechanics?**
   - Yes → Option 1 or 3
   - No → Option 2 is fine

5. **Does your team have game dev experience?**
   - Yes → Any option
   - No → Avoid Option 3

## Conclusion

For an **incremental game with bouncing number animations at 60fps in a 70/30 TUI layout**, **Option 1 provides the optimal balance** of:
